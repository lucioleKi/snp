You can read a longer version of description there.\n\nAbout the game, a TLDR version:\nThe Sacred and The Profane is a narrative-driven game featuring 6 main characters and 10 other characters, set in a pseudo-medieval world. The game is implemented as a mod of Cultist Simulator, heavily using its framework. The lore or story is NOT related to Cultist Simulator's universe at all.This is a demo version for The Sacred and The Profane, containing the first 3 chapters of the game. Anticipated game time is ~15 minutes.\n\nFAQ\nQ: What is the demo about?\nA: It's the first 3 chapters of the game. The first chapter starts with a knight waiting for someone. The second and the third chapter unfold at different locations. We try to show the core features of the game in this demo. Inevitably there are features that can only be apparent with more chapters. The story will only get more fun.\nQ: How many chapters are there in total, and when do you plan to finish them?\nA: There are approximately 30 chapters in total. We plan to release new demo versions every 3-4 chapters. We hope to make the next release in February 2024.\nQ: I've encountered a bug. What do I do?\nContact K on steam or discord. We'll try to fix it asap.\nQ: What if I have other feedback or questions about the game?\nSame as above. Contact K on steam or discord. We welcome all kinds of feedback.\n\nCredits\nK (lucioleKi@github, Maitimo@steam, seal2004@discord) - Design, Code, Writing\nSelenocysteine - Writing\nIcons used by the game are either from Sixth History art assets, or listed in icon_credits.txt."
