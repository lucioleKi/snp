## About the game, a TLDR version:

*The Sacred and The Profane* is a narrative-driven game featuring 6 main characters and 10 other characters, set in a pseudo-medieval world. The game is implemented as a mod of Cultist Simulator, heavily using its framework. The lore or story is NOT related to Cultist Simulator's universe at all.

This is a demo version for *The Sacred and The Profane*, containing the first 3 chapters of the game. Anticipated game time is ~15 minutes.

## Download and Installation:

You can download the demo (version number 0.0.3) under the **Release** tab on the right. The downloaded folder should be placed at %YOUR_USERNAME%\AppData\LocalLow\Weather Factory\Cultist Simulator\mods. %YOUR_USERNAME% is your username for the computer. The demo requires no further installation. You should be able to see it as a new **Legacy**. 

## About *The Sacred and The Profane*
Play as 6 main characters and 10 other characters in this narrative-driven game. Watch everything unfold in a medieval town: Piety, betrayal, ambition, love, and above all, freedom.

This is a choice-matter game. The story is not linear. Every main character will have their core story line and multiple side quests. The first 3 chapters may not show all of those yet. Trust us - We've already planned out the story.

The game's basic mechanism is similar to Cultist Simulator. In the very beginning, you'll start with a **Knight** card, and a location **bench on the pier**. You can drag the Knight onto that bench, where the Knight can **wait for someone**. After 10 seconds of game time, the waiting ends and another character appears. You've got your journey started.

The story flow in this game is driven by **Required Events**. They always present themselves as cards indicating their locations. For example, you could get a card called **Event: Tower**. It means that the event happens to a few specific characters on a tower. You can drag the event card to the location Tower, and see which characters are needed for the event. How the event plays out can sometimes be up to you. 
The 6 characters have a total of 12 skills they can improve and master. From archer to herbalist, you can choose to let the characters learn different skills. A certain level in a skill can unlock event, memory, or new possibilities in the future.

Although the game currently has no combat (yet), it's better to not let your guard down. Game will be over if a main character dies or you make a certain establishment run out of funds!

*P.S. You (well, not really you, two of the characters in-game) can pet a cat!*
